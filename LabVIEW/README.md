# EL562 LabVIEW Lab
## Part 1. Control an LED using a switch
Now use LabVIEW to develop the following VI.
As shown in Figure 1, add an LED, a switch and a stop button to the Front Panel.
Figure 1. Front panel for simple LED control
Build the block diagram as shown in Figure 2. Run the program and see how it works.

Make sure to save your VI program on your X:drive.

**Attach the front panel and block diagram of your VI program to your report and add brief notes to
explain how the block diagram works. [5 marks]**
## Part 2. Generate a blinking LED
Remove the switch from the front panel and then modify the block diagram to flash the LED. When
you run the modified program, LED will be blinking (on for 1 second and off for 1 second). Press the
stop button on the front panel to stop the program.
Make sure to save your modified VI program on your X:drive.

**Attach the front panel and block diagram of your modified VI program to your report and add brief
notes to explain how the block diagram works. [5 marks]**
## Part 3. Build traffic lights
Based on the front panel from Part 2, add two more LEDs. You will have a red LED, a yellow LED, a
green LED and a stop button on the front panel. Modify the block diagram to produce the standard
traffic light sequence:
|Colour|Duration|
|----|----|
|Red|2 seconds|
|Red and Yellow|1 second|
|Green|2 seconds|
|Yellow|1 second|  

Return to Red and repeat the sequence  
The program will be stopped when you press the stop button on the front panel.  

**Attach the front panel and block diagram of your modified VI program to your report and add brief
notes to explain how the block diagram works. [15 marks]**  

**Note: submit your report and the VI programs of Part 2 and Part 3 to the submission folder
(“LabVIEW Lab” on EL562 Moodle page).**
